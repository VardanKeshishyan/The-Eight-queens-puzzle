# The-Eight-queens-puzzle
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century.

A C++ program that solves the classic Eight Queens Puzzle, which involves placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The puzzle requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century, and there are 92 possible solutions.

**Description**

The Eight Queens Puzzle Solver is an implementation of the backtracking algorithm to find solutions to the Eight Queens Puzzle. The program uses an object-oriented approach, with classes representing the chessboard and the queens.

The program systematically explores different configurations of queen placements, starting from the first row and moving row by row. It checks for conflicts between queens in terms of rows, columns, and diagonals. If a conflict is detected, the program backtracks to the previous row and tries a different position for the queen. This process continues until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

The program outputs all possible solutions for the Eight Queens Puzzle. Each solution is represented as a chessboard with the queens' positions indicated. The program also provides the total count of solutions found.

**Usage**

Run the program, and it will automatically find and display all possible solutions for the Eight Queens Puzzle.
Each solution is represented as a chessboard with the queens' positions indicated by 'Q'.
The program will also output the total count of solutions found.
